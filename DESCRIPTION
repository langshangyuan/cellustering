Description: A toolkit for preprocessing and clustering of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This package is designed for users to identify and exploit the heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomic measurements. Adhering to the standard streamlined scRNA-seq workflow, “cellustering” provides functions for quality control, normalization, feature selection, scaling, dimension reduction, clustering and subsequent results evaluation. See Luecken and Theis (2019) <![doi: 10.15252/msb.20188746](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20188746)> for more details.
