Description: A toolkit for preprocessing and clustering of single-cell RNA
    sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This package is designed for users to identify
    and exploit the heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomic measurements.
    Adhering to the standard streamlined scRNA-seq workflow, 'cellustering'
    provides functions for quality control, normalization, feature selection,
    scaling, dimension reduction, clustering and subsequent results evaluation.
